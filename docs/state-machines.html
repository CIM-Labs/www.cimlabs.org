  </section>

  <section id="summary">
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Mealy State Machines are integrated into the CIM architecture for event generation based on message state transitions.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="overview">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>In a Mealy State Machine, each state transition is governed by both an input and an output. In the context of CIM, the inputs are Messages—comprising Commands, Queries, and Events—and the outputs are Events generated as a result of the message processing.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="states-as-homotopy-types">
    <h3>States as Homotopy Types</h3>
    <p>Homotopy is a way of classifying geometric regions by studying the different types of paths that can be drawn in the region.</p>
    <p>Each state in the Mealy State Machine can be considered a Homotopy Type. This classification of states into types enables a rigorous, mathematical framework for reasoning about the system's behavior. Moreover, state transitions can be viewed as morphisms between these types.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="functional-morphisms-for-state-transitions">
    <h3>Functional Morphisms for State Transitions</h3>
    <p>Each transition function (or morphism) should adhere to the standards of a Grothendieck construction, ensuring a strict and well-defined transition process. For example, a message in state <code>A</code> triggering a transition to state <code>B</code> would involve a morphism <code>f: A -&gt; B</code>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="event-generation-process">
    <h2 >Event Generation Process</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Message Reception</strong>: Upon the receipt of a message, an <code>MessageReceived</code> event is generated as the initial output. This event also serves to log the incoming message for tracking and auditing purposes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Authorization</strong>: The message undergoes an authorization check.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>For Commands, this produces a <code>CommandAuthorized</code> event.</li>
    <li>For Queries, a <code>QueryAuthorized</code> event is generated.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>State Transition and Event Emission</strong>: The authorized message initiates a state transition, effectively triggering another morphism that reflects the change from one Homotopy Type to another. An associated <code>MessageProcessed</code> event is emitted to signify this transition.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Persistence</strong>: Finally, the new state is persisted, and a <code>MessagePersisted</code> event is generated.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section id="communication-architecture">
    <h2>Communication Architecture</h2>
    <p>CIM employs a gossip protocol to disseminate messages across its internal network. Each node in this network hosts a messenger service managed by systemd and NixOS. This decentralized approach ensures that the Mealy State Machine's transitions and event generations are consistent across all instances.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="properties-of-the-cim-model-with-mealy-state-machines">
    <h2>Properties of the CIM Model with Mealy State Machines</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Functional Integrity</strong>: The system is structured so that each state and each transition function (morphism) adheres to functional programming paradigms. This facilitates easier reasoning and proofs about the system's behavior.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Immutability</strong>: All events are immutable and uniquely identified via CIDs (Content Identifiers), contributing to the integrity and traceability of the system.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Modularity</strong>: Following the UNIX philosophy of &quot;Do one thing and do it well,&quot; each module in the system is designed to handle a specific function or process, reinforcing the principles of modularity and separation of concerns.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>In summary, the integration of Mealy State Machines into the CIM architecture offers a structured, mathematical, and functional approach to event generation based on message state transitions.</p>
