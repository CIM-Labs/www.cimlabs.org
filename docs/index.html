      A <b>Composable Information Machine</b> is a private network of compute devices operating together to provide a `Distributed Domain Specific System`. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A `Domain Specific System` is a type of computer system that is designed to solve problems within a specific domain or area of expertise. It is a specialized system that is designed to target a specific type of problem and is typically tailored to a particular industry or application. This type of system is used to solve highly specific problems and is typically designed with the input of domain-specific experts who understand the needs of the specific industry or application. Domain Specific Systems are generally more efficient and cost-effective than general-purpose systems, as they are designed to address a specific set of requirements. `Distributed` means we connect many of these together to for a more resilient, partitioned network of systems.

      This is a reproducible system, meaning it is able to be duplicated or restored into any state the system has. We build your Business DNA to provide your Core Domain regardless of the hardware, software or processes you use.

      Event sourcing can be applied to conceptual spaces. Event sourcing can be used to track changes in a conceptual space, such as changes in the meanings of words or changes in the structure of a concept. By using event sourcing to store changes, it is possible to reconstruct past states and track changes over time.
